random info...

see asconfig.json:

each worker instantiate each wasm module ...passing the global memory + the
other import vars... 

->att on module instance vs import for let module var ? For now we use only one
module (the engine worker module) and all other files are simply imported (with
import in each other), so we avoid problems with multiple modules with different
var referring to the same location in memory (es free list ptr for the worker
alloc, while the shared heap alloc should be ok since var are locked in
memory...?)

wasm mem layout:
reserved by app | module memory (data + heap):  the module part starts from the
memoryBase value in asconfig: since we don't use the data+heap part we set it to
the start value * page size....maybe we don't set it ?

remove these? i don't use the data+heap part so...
    "initialMemory": 10,
    "memoryBase": 4194304,

TODO: !
Since we are directly writing to memory in this example, and there exists a
runtime in AssemblyScript, be sure to take a look at the --memoryBase flag in
the AssemblyScript compiler. See here:
https://wasmbyexample.dev/examples/webassembly-linear-memory/webassembly-linear-memory.assemblyscript.en-us.html

as: 

module imports:

// assembly/env.ts
export declare function logInteger(i: i32): void
https://www.assemblyscript.org/concepts.html

Note on init:
A solution is to utilize the --exportStart command line option to force
exporting the start function instead of making it implicit. Then, instantiation
first returns before any code is executed. Note, however, that the exported
start function must always be called first, before any other exports, or
undefined behavior will occur.  #

see note on bit shifts and the least significant bits of the shift...

Calling memory.grow where a memory manager is present might break it.

Width 100% : It will make content width 100%. margin, border, padding will be added to this width and element will overflow if any of these added.
Width auto : It will fit the element in available space including margin, border and padding. space remaining after adjusting margin + padding + border will be available width/ height.
Width 100% + box-sizing: border box : It will also fits the element in available space including border, padding (margin will make it overflow the container).

-how to link another remote:

for ex. from a specific project that wants to link this as another remote:

git remote add base-origin https://github.com/dbusrepo/web-graphics-base.git
gco base-origin/main -> switch to main branch of base proj
gcob base-origin-main -> create a local branch on it
git branch -u base-origin/main  <- set tracking with remote branch
git pull base-origin main (or simply git pull after the prev cmd) <- we pull from the main branch of base proj

similarly if we want to add to this proj another remote from a specifi proj:

git remote add ray-casting-origin https://github.com/dbusrepo/web-ray-casting.git

show local-remote tracking branches for origin and another remote
(base-graphics for ex.):
$ git remote show origin
$ git remote show base-graphics
